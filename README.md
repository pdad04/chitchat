# chitchat
Chat application built with React

I built *chitchat* as a way to get more practice using React JS and Firebase. *Chitchat* is a simple chat application that allows users to create rooms and send/view messages for rooms. 

# Running Chitchat

To run *Chitchat* clone the repo to your local system `cd` into the directory and from the command line run `npm start`.
